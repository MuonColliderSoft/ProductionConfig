# Configuration files used for the luminosity studies

These files refer to an old configuration (November 2020) before the official ones (see for example 003-HiggsStudies).

It differs from 003-HiggsStudies for:

- The wrong number for Bfield in Calo.xml (1.5 instead of 1.34)
- The times cuts on DigiOverlay.xml
- The detector resolutions in TrackerDigitization.xml
