# Higgs Signal Simulation

Differs from BASE version for using as Physic list: *QGSP_BERT_HP*

- same as QGSP_BERT, but with high precision neutron model 
- used for neutrons below 20 MeV
- significantly slower than QGSP_BERT when full thermal cross sections used
- can be used for radiation protection and shielding applications
